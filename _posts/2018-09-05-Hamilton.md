Reflection Paper on Ron Chernow’s Alexander Hamilton

## Theme
  One thing can be noted to be a theme that permeates this whole work by Ron Chernow; An individual’s behaviour, attitude, motivations, obsessions can in a lot of ways be affected by his or her history, but every individual has a choice on how he or she allows the events of his or her past to paint the present. Ron Chernow in this work narrating the life of the quintessential federalist Alexander Hamilton, points out how he refused to live in the shadow of his checkered history of illegitimacy and tried in almost every way he could to clean this seeming stain. Although this sometimes resulted in Hamilton responding in reactions brewing with paranoia and engaging in some morally flawed actions, it can be quite reasonably inferred from Ron Chernow’s perspective that this checkered history to a reasonable extent served as a motivation to Hamilton. Hence the thesis to this work by Ron Chernow can be said to be; Alexander Hamilton was a man of great ambition and great love for the United States, but was also a man greatly troubled by his checkered childhood history.
## Chernow's Thesis
  The first sentence in the first chapter of Ron Chernow’s work, go a long way in proving his a major point in his thesis; Hamilton’s checkered history. He starts by saying; “Alexander Hamilton claimed nevis in the British West Indies as his birth place, although no surviving record substantiate this”. This statement already begins to show the reader that the main character of this book is one who seems to have a history that is not so lucid but one that can be said to be complicated. In a tone that leaves a reader in a reader with sympathy Chernow brings to light the circumstances surrounding Hamilton’s birth and childhood. He sheds light on Hamilton’s mother’s tumultuous marriage to Johann Lavien, her running away, and her relationship with James Hamilton along with other unfortunate events in Hamilton’s childhood. He says; “Let us pause briefly to tally the grim catalog of disasters that had befallen these two boys between 1765 and 1769: their father had vanished, their mother had died, their cousin and supposed protector had committed bloody suicide and their aunt, uncle and grandmother had all died”. This list pointed by Chernow clearly supports the fact that Alexander Hamilton had a childhood that was really checkered. James Hamilton who was Hamilton’s father was the son of a Scottish laird. This seemed to be point Hamilton took pride in about his roots as he tried to soothe the sting of illegitimacy. 
## Who is Ron Chernow
Ron Chernow is a journalist, historian, biographer and writer from the United States of America. An alumni of prestigious universities such as Yale University, Cambridge and Pembroke College, he is a very experienced biographer as he has written on other notable names in American history such as George Washington and John D. Rockefeller. Ron Chernow also has been noted by government and academia to be a very credible writer, as he has in the past bagged a number of  awards one of which is; the Pulitzer Prize for Biography.
Ron Chernow did indeed prove his thesis masterfully and in a captivating manner. With a high amount of skill, he was able to portray Alexander as a man who was haunted by his troubled childhood for most of his life, and this troubling seemed to be a basis for a lot of things he did. He also successfully was able to still portray Hamilton as despite being troubled, as a man with a great dream and vision in mind for America. He was able to prove his thesis which is; Alexander Hamilton was a man of great ambition and great love for the United States, but was also a man greatly troubled by his checkered childhood history.
## Opinion
In my opinion I believe Ron Chernow, put together a wonderful, thorough, captivating, thought provoking and credible work on Alexander Hamilton. Hedid a great work in shedding a great deal of light on the life of the face on the ten dollar bill. He successfully answered this question by Aaron Burr in the song Alexander Hamilton; “How does a bastard, orphan, son of a whore and a Scotsman, dropped in the middle of a forgotten spot in the Caribbean by providence impoverished, in squalor, grow up to be a hero and a scholar?”.  Ron Chernow points out that his keen intelligence, determination, ambitious character, and zeal coupled with a race against his tumultuous childhood played a role in answering how. Ron Chernow with great dexterity was able to draw out sympathy and admiration for this founding father in this book without trying to throw his moral blunders beneath the rug. This work by Ron Chernow is a great resource on American history and a great work of art.
