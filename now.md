My name is Ojoniko Nathan Abah. I am presently a student at Murray State University, 
studying computer science. I am also in my junior year and I am minoring in data analytics.
I work on campus with the department of physics and engineering and also as a tutor with
the student support services. Being a stuudent worker at the physics and engineering department,
I usually am opportuned to work on differnt projects which is usually interesting as it gives 
me an opportunity to learn and improve my programming skills.
