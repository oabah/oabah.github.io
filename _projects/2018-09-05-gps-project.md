## GPS Project
This is a project that we intend to enhance into becoming a virtual fence system.
This will enable livestock farmers to keep track of their animals better and also aid in placing boundaries
around them. This system will be able to notify the farmers, once the livestock is out of the
desigated boundary. This project is still at it's elementary level, but as time goes on hopefully
it will be expanded.
