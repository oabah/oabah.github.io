## Snake Project
This project is an interesting one as it has many real life uses.
A major use of this is its effectiveness in helping in a disaster search.
In situations such as earthquakes when it can be difficult to get beneath rubbles 
and piles a snake robot can come in handy. 
We are making use of an arduino uno for this project along with a number of servos.
The body parts for this snake robot, are going to be 3d printed and the language with which the 
code will be written in will be c.
Although there are already existing snake robots, this will be a good exposure for me and the
students involved in this project as this will help sharpen my programming and project designing skills.
Hopefully in the future, innovations will be added to the project with will be original.
